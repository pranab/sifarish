Dependent jars
==============
sifarish depends on the following jar libraries. Most of them are third party except for
chombo and hoidla. For these two you could either checkout the jars and place them in your
local maven repo or you could build them.

Some of them are needed only when using some special features, as indicated by the text in 
parenthesis

jackson-core-asl-1.9.13.jar (always needed)
jackson-mapper-asl-1.9.13.jar (always needed)
lucene-core-4.4.0.jar (text matching features)
lucene-analyzers-common-4.4.0.jar (text matching features, other language analyzers)
lucene-analyzers-morfologik-4.4.0.jar (text matching features, polish language analyzer)
chombo-1.0.jar (my project, always needed)
hoidla-1.0.jar (my project, neede for real time features)
jena-arq-2.9.4.jar (semantic feature)

Building dependent jars
=======================
Follow these steps if you have decided to build the jars for chombo and hoidla

Checkout project chombo and run
mvn clean install

Checkout project hoidla and run
mvn clean install

Handling dependency
===================
There are many ways to handle dependency in Hadoop

1. Use libjar command line options as below
hadoop jar xyz.jar com.example.MyMapreduce -libjars path1/lib1.jar,path2/lib2.jar

2. Use maven shade plugin to package all jars into one uber jar. The following needs to
be added to the build element in pom.xml
<build>
.......
	<plugins>
		<plugin>
			<groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
			<artifactId>maven-shade-plugin</artifactId>
			<executions>
				<execution>
					<phase>package</phase>
					<goals>
						<goal>shade</goal>
					</goals>
				</execution>
			</executions>
			<configuration>
				<finalName>uber-${artifactId}-${version}</finalName>
			</configuration>
		</plugin>
	</plugins>
.......
</build>

3. Use ant to package all dependent jars. You could use ../resource/build_hadoop.xml as an example

4. Copy all jars to hadoop lib directory in all nodes
